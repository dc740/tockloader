# Package tockloader.tbfh Documentation

## Class TBFHeader
Tock Binary Format header class. This can parse TBF encoded headers and
return various properties of the application.
### \_\_init\_\_
```py

def __init__(self, buffer)

```



Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.


### get\_app\_name
```py

def get_app_name(self)

```



Return the package name if it was encoded in the header, otherwise
return a tuple of (package_name_offset, package_name_size).


### get\_app\_size
```py

def get_app_size(self)

```



Get the total size the app takes in bytes in the flash of the chip.


### get\_binary
```py

def get_binary(self)

```



Get the TBF header in a bytes array.


### get\_header\_size
```py

def get_header_size(self)

```



Get the size of the header in bytes. This includes any alignment
padding at the end of the header.


### is\_enabled
```py

def is_enabled(self)

```



Whether the application is marked as enabled. Enabled apps start when
the board boots, and disabled ones do not.


### is\_modified
```py

def is_modified(self)

```



Whether the TBF header has been modified by Tockloader after it was
initially read in (either from a new TAB or from the board).


### is\_sticky
```py

def is_sticky(self)

```



Whether the app is marked sticky and won't be erase during normal app
erases.


### is\_valid
```py

def is_valid(self)

```



Whether the CRC and other checks passed for this header.


### set\_app\_size
```py

def set_app_size(self, size)

```



Set the total size the app takes in bytes in the flash of the chip.

Since this does not change the header size we do not need to update
any other fields in the header.


### set\_flag
```py

def set_flag(self, flag_name, flag_value)

```



Set a flag in the TBF header.

Valid flag names: `enable`, `sticky`


### \_\_str\_\_
```py

def __str__(self)

```



Return str(self).


### \_checksum
```py

def _checksum(self, buffer)

```



Calculate the TBF header checksum.
